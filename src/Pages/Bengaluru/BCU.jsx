      Has been serving the knowledge industry with the help of <br></br>esteemed torchbearers of information and expertise. They are recognized as a leading institute of higher <br></br>education in India. Preparing their students to be professionals in creating or re-creating, being appreciative of <br></br>their skill, and learn to monetize it rightly. Creating entrepreneurs can be overwhelming, but with them, it's <br></br> a journey towards evolution.

      <h2 style={{marginTop: "20px", lineHeight: "40px", fontSize: "30px"}}>Solution Overview</h2>

      <li>Search filter</li>
      <p>The introduction of a search filter would enable both confident and uncertain students to get a comprehensive view <br></br>of the courses and subjects offered by the university.</p>

      <li>Application form</li>
      <p>The application form feature is essential to bridge the communication gap between the university and students,<br></br> serving as the initial step in the application process.</p>

      <li>Online application</li>
      <p>The 'Apply Online' feature is particularly beneficial for international students or those residing out of state who <br></br>are certain about the course offered by the university. It streamlines the application process for those eager to<br></br> move forward with their applications.</p>

      <img src={apply} alt="" style={{width: "50vw", marginLeft: "100px", marginTop: "50px"}}/>

      <li>Chatbot</li>
      <p>The AI-generated chatbox is designed for students who are in the exploratory phase, wanting to connect with <br></br>administrators to inquire about the range of courses the university offers and more.</p>

      <p style={{marginTop: "20px", fontSize: "20px", lineHeight: "30px"}}>As I was searching for a university for my further education, I came across BCU. Of course, being the reputable <br></br>university that it is, I wanted to include its name on my resume. However, I found it challenging to <br></br>navigate through the website and input my information to request a callback and obtain details about the <br></br>course. Although I am a local, I could have simply called the university, but that too proved to be a struggle.</p>

      <h4 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "50px", textTransform: "capitalize", color: "black", marginBottom: "30px"}}>How</h4>
      <p style={{marginTop: "-20px"}}>After conducting research and identifying numerous competitors among other universities, I propose the <br></br>implementation of a search filter feature. This feature would provide students with ample options to <br></br>choose from various courses, subjects, and degrees. Additionally, I suggest incorporating a form that <br></br>allows students to request a callback from the university administration, facilitating the initiation of their <br></br>application process. Furthermore, we can include an 'Apply Online' option for students who are certain <br></br>about the course they want to pursue. This would streamline the application process, or alternatively, <br></br>assist them in reserving a seat for a specific subject.</p>

      <h4 style={{ fontSize: "20px", marginTop: "50px", textTransform: "capitalize", color: "black", marginBottom: "30px"}}>Benefits</h4>
      <p>This feature offers benefits to both the university and students. Although it may seem like a simple <br></br>change, it holds significant importance as it enhances communication between both parties. <br></br>The implementation allows for the seamless processing and follow-up of student applications, <br></br>ensuring a smoother experience overall.</p>

      <h2 style={{marginTop: "20px", lineHeight: "40px", fontSize: "30px"}}> Design process & challenges</h2>
      <p>Every day, over 5000 students in India and 1000 students in Bangalore alone are actively searching <br></br>for universities. To design and implement this feature, it should be accessible to different types of <br></br>students visiting the websiteâ€”those who are certain about their choices and those who are still <br></br>exploring options.</p>

      <p>To cater to both groups, I propose adding a search filter that accommodates various preferences. <br></br>Additionally, incorporating an AI-generated chatbox can significantly enhance communication speed,<br></br> especially for students who prefer not to spend more than 15 minutes on a website. This feature, <br></br>especially beneficial for those who are uncertain about their choices, will connect them with a <br></br>counselor promptly.</p>

      <p>Challenges in implementing this feature revolve around seamlessly integrating it into the university's <br></br>existing website, which is already operational. The addition should align with the established design <br></br>standards of the university while addressing any existing shortcomings. Ensuring cohesion with the <br></br>current website structure and enhancing it where necessary presents a key challenge in this <br></br>implementation.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, the proposed features - search filter, application form, 'Apply Online,' and AI-generated chatbox <br></br>- represent a strategic approach to enhancing the user experience on Bengaluru City University's website. <br></br>Tailored for both confident and exploratory students, these features aim to streamline communication and <br></br>application processes. The search filter offers a comprehensive course overview, while the application form <br></br>initiates vital communication. 'Apply Online' caters to international and out-of-state students, and the<br></br> AI-generated chatbox facilitates swift communication for those exploring the university. Collectively, these <br></br>enhancements signify a commitment to user-centric design, providing a more accessible and responsive <br></br>digital platform for students' diverse needs.</p>
